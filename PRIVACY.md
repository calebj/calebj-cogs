# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2018-06-27

Caleb Johnson ("I", "my" or "me") develops the cogs [here](https://github.com/calebj/calebj-cogs) (the "Cogs", or a "Cog"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information I receive from users of the Cogs.

I use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Cogs. By using the Cogs, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection And Use

While using the Cogs, you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to: your username, bot ID and user ID ("Personal Information").

## Log Data

Like many developers, I collect information that your bot sends whenever you use my products, in this case the Cogs ("Log Data").

This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, bot type and version, operating system and software versions, the Cogs that you install, the commands belonging to those Cogs that you run, the times and dates of your usage, hashed user IDs and other statistics.

In addition, I may use third party services to collect, monitor and analyze this data.

## Communications

I may use your Personal Information to contact you with information about Cog features, upcoming changes, or other relevant information.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2017-04-27 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Cogs after I post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
